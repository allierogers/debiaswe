        <h3>About Analogies</h3>
        <div class="center">
            <p>To generate analogies, we applied Bolukbasi et. al.'s procedure, and leveraged their code, to modify the classic analogy task. Instead of filling in only one word (e.g. he is to she as him is to ____), we generate pairs of words (x, y) such that he to x as she to y is a good analogy. To quote the paper, "This modification allows us to systematically generate pairs of words that the embedding believes it analogous to he, she (or any other pair of seed words)." After calculating a seed direction vector_he - vector_she (or the equivalent for any other two input words a and b), we scored all possible pairs of words x, y by the following metric:</p>
            <p>S_(a,b)(x, y) = cos(vector_a - vector_b, vector_x - vector_y) if ||vector_x - vector_y || < delta, else 0. </p>
            <p>Where delta is a threshold for similarity so that we are not generating analogies with words that are so different, it is hard for a human to understand their relationship!</p>
            <p>The paper crowdsourced feedback on the analogies generated by major word embeddings and found a significant number of stereotypical analogies prior to debiasing.</p>
